## Summary
  - From June to December, the temperature does not stray way from the min and max.  
  - The delta is under 10°F for the min and 5°F for the max which is suitable all year around in Oahu.  Based on the average temperature, opening a shop year round is acceptable.   
### Additional Queries
  - It would be best to analyze the preciptiation of the two months. It'll draw a better conclusion on the weather conditions in June and December.  
  - Also, using the stations location would make the data more precise of the temperature and precipitation.
